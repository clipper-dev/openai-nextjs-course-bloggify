This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It is a simple boilerplate for a Next.js app with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS. Also it includes a boilerplate connection to a MongoDB database using generic driver.

A few extra NMP packages are included to make development easier:
- recoil
- framer-motion
- uuid
- react-icons
- react-toastify
- react-time-ago

Created by [Clipper](github.com/clipper-dev)

## Getting Started

Create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app -e https://github.com/clipper-dev/nextjs-mongo-starter
```

This will create a new project named **my-app** in its own directory that will be stilised as this template repo.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
